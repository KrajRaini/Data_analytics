# Data Analytics Learning Portfolio

Welcome to my **Data Analytics Journey Repository**! This repo showcases my hands-on learning path from beginner to job-ready data analyst, featuring self-created Excel assessments, projects, and dashboards built with Power BI, Tableau, SQL, and more. Starting with my first Excel income-expense tracker, it documents practical exercises aligned with modern data analytics roadmaps targeting MNC roles.[1]

## What's Inside
- **Excel Projects**: Basic trackers and assessments practicing formulas, tables, and data organization (e.g., Personal Income & Expense Tracker).[1]
- **Power BI & Tableau**: Interactive dashboards for sales, finance, and business metrics (coming soon).
- **SQL Queries**: Real-world analysis scripts for data extraction, joins, and aggregations.
- **Future Additions**: Python/Pandas scripts, full case studies, and portfolio-ready visualizations.

## Learning Roadmap Progress
Built from zero knowledge post B.Tech CSE, following a 4-6 month plan: Excel → SQL → BI Tools → Stats → Projects. All resources are free (CodeBasics, YouTube). Track my evolution here as I aim for remote MNC data analyst positions.[2]
